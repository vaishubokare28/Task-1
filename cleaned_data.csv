# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Script

This Python script automates data cleaning and preprocessing tasks on a dataset from a ZIP archive. It leverages the `pandas` library to ensure that the dataset is cleaned, formatted, and ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Description

This script is designed to clean and preprocess raw datasets. Specifically, it:
- Loads a CSV file from a ZIP archive.
- Handles missing values by filling or dropping them.
- Removes duplicate rows.
- Standardizes text values (e.g., gender, country names).
- Converts date columns to a consistent format.
- Renames column headers for uniformity.
- Ensures appropriate data types (e.g., integer for age, float for ratings).

## Features

- **Missing Value Handling**: Automatically identifies and fills or drops missing values in the dataset.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Cleans up duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
- **Text Standardization**: Standardizes text columns by converting to lowercase, stripping spaces, and normalizing values like gender.
- **Date Format Conversion**: Ensures date columns are in a consistent format (`dd-mm-yyyy`).
- **Column Name Standardization**: Cleans column names by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.
- **Price Cleaning**: Removes non-numeric characters (e.g., currency symbols, commas) from price columns.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converts columns to appropriate data types (e.g., `int` for age, `float` for ratings).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- ZIP file containing a CSV

You can install the required library by running the following:

```bash
pip install pandas
